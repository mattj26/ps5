(* TODO: Replace the implementation of the crawl function (currently
   just a stub returning the empty dictionary) with a proper index of
   crawled pages. Build an index as follows:

   Remove a link from the frontier (the set of links that have yet to
   be visited), visit this link, add its outgoing links to the
   frontier, and update the index so that all words on this page are
   mapped to linksets containing this url.

   Keep crawling until we've reached the maximum number of links (n) or
   the frontier is empty.
